####:heavy_exclamation_mark: This repo is no longer maintained. We rebuilt everything from scratch in [MyHomeworkSpace/Client](https://github.com/MyHomeworkSpace/client) and it is a lot better. It also requires the new API server at [MyHomeworkSpace/api-server](https://github.com/MyHomeworkSpace/api-server). Thanks!
